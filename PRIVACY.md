# Privacy Policy?

The only data that is stored is that provided by Slack when [installing an application](https://github.com/slackapi/node-slack-sdk/blob/f29c3b7ec05412a8b8712a1d180f4d6cbd38039e/packages/oauth/src/index.ts#L645-L709), [uninstalling an application](https://api.slack.com/events/app_uninstalled), or [customizing emoji](api.slack.com/events/emoji_changed). This includes basic information about the workspace in which the application was installed and the ID of the user who installed the application. This data is used solely for the purpose of operating the application.

All data used for the operation about an installation is deleted when the application is uninstalled. Application logs are stored for [up to one week](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/logging#log-history-limits).
