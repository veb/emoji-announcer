### Requirements

To run the app, all that is required is node.js and a database that is compatible with [sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize). The app comes with support for PostgreSQL and SQLite. To use other databases, you will need to install the relevant packages for sequelize to function correctly (but no code changes!).
